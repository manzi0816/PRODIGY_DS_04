# PRODIGY_DS_04
This project was done under the Prodigy InfoTech Internship Program. This is task #04 of the series. This task features analysis and visualization of sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitude towards specific topics or brands with the help of #Jupyter, #Matplotlib, #Pandas and #Textblob with a pre-made dataset that I downloaded from kaggle as a csv file.

Two files have been uploaded. 
sent(1).ipynb was an initial test file which contains multiple errors committed during my laerning process
sentiment.ipynb is a clean file without any errors and a clear output
